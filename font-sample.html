    <h1 class="bold-font">People in movies don't know how to fly helicopters</h1>
    <p class="thin-font">In every movie where a helicopter crashes, you see the pilot yelling with both hands on the stick. He's is desperately trying to keep the helo from crashing in the worst possible manner. What this pilot doesn't seem to realize is that the control for actually making the aircraft go up and down is next to the seat to his/her left. Possibly the reason why the aircraft seems uncontrollable is because the pilot doesn't have an actual understanding about how the flight controls work.</p>
